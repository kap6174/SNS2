PHASE 1:

Both doctor and patient generates the p, g, y, x at their end and send to each other.
The doctor then generates a session key randomly and uses the patient's public key to encrypt using elgamals algorithm and then sends c1, c2 to the patient.
The patient upon receving this c1, c2 decrypts using his own private key x using the elgamals decryption algorithm. Now both the doctor and patient have agreed upon the session key which we will use for AES encryption for the actual messages when sent!

PHASE2:

There was no need for session key generation in phase 1. It has been removed. Session key has been generated in phase 2.

Run doctor.py as follows:
'''
python doctor.py --id "2"
'''

Run patient.py as follows:

'''
python patient.py --patient-id "3" --doctor-id "2"
'''

The entire authentication part has been taken care in phase 2. 

TODO: Make multiple client and store their information seperately in a dictionary not done yet.
